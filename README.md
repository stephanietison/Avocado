# Avocado
Springboard Capstone Project 1

The question to answer is:

How can I predict the volume of 
avocados that will be sold, 
and their price?

The dataset I will use for this project is available to download as excel files from the Hass Avocado Board website (http://www.hassavocadoboard.com).

For the scope of this project, I will use total US price and volume for years 2016-2018, for the conventional Hass Avocado.
I will add an indicator to the dataset to see if the federal holidays have an influence on the avocado sales.
 
The techniques to use in this project will be Time Series modeling and forecasting.
 
The deliverables will be Jupyter Notebook, a technical report and a presentation of the project.
